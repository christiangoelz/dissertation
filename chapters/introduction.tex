    \item Age related changes occur at different scales and are manifestet at several levels.
    \item There is a wide variety in how this changes occur
    \item Changes are e.g. neural dedifferentiation and compensatory mechanisms (see Reuter Lorenz et al. 2010) and are noticable brain network level and dynamics
    \item NOTE: Check what EEG studies said about this...
    \item The idea is to model these changes with tools from datascience to answer questions in aging neurosci
    \item First study is about detecting dedifferentiated and compensatory mechanisms with EEG
    \item Tools used are DMD and Machine learning
    \item Main idea: Study classification performance as proxy for age related changes in different motor control tasks
    \item Expertise as possible way of builing a reserve:
    \item Higher individuality 
    \item Dynamics of dedifferentiation and how do they relate to fitness
    \item Basic for targeted interventions 
    \item How much and what (relate to Julia)
    \item Background of ML
    \item ML as tool 
    \item novel insights 
    \item Problem: Data is multidimensional and we have often limited data 
    \item Solution: Use DMD to reduce Complexity and "model" evolution of signal 
    \item Dynamic Mode Decompsition
    \item DMD extracts coupled spatio-temporal modes and is able to kind of model the evolution of the signal
