Classification of motor task conditions from \gls{eeg} data may provide insights into age-related changes such as dedifferentiation activation of motor networks. So far, only isolated studies have investigated this for one-dimensional task conditions and indeed found losses in classification performance in older adults when classifying right and left-handed motor tasks \cite{Chen2019}. The intention was to use classifiers trained to differentiate between different task conditions to detect age-related changes in visuomotor tracking tasks.\\

To describe the classifier input, classical statistical analyses revealed significant differences in the expression of \gls{dmd} patterns between tasks and groups focusing mainly on central and posterior electrodes, most pronounced in the $\beta$ frequency bands. In addition, there were differences in the spatial distribution with respect to a more bilateral and frontal expression of the patterns in the late-middle aged adults.\\

We trained the classifier to output the appropriate task label based on the EEG data (tracking a sinusoidal target force with the left hand vs. a sinusoidal target force with the right hand vs. a steady target force with the left hand vs. a steady target force with the right hand). The analysis, shown in Figure 1, yielded different results for younger and late middle-aged adults. Classification of hand side in the late middle-aged participants performed significantly worse, i.e., the classifier misclassified trials performed with the right hand as left-handed trials and vice versa. On the other hand, the classification of which target force was followed, i.e. steady vs sinus, worked significantly better in the late middle-aged adults.
