The aim of this research article was to investigate whether age-related differences in the central processing of fine motor skills can be captured by machine learning based on the classification of different force control tasks in younger and older adults.
\\
To describe the classifier input, classical statistical analyses revealed significant differences in the expression of \gls{dmd} patterns between tasks and groups focusing mainly on central and posterior electrodes, most pronounced in the $\beta$ frequency bands. In addition, there were differences in the spatial distribution with respect to a more bilateral and frontal expression of the patterns in the late-middle aged adults.\\
\\
We trained the classifier to output the appropriate task label based on the EEG data (tracking a sinusoidal target force with the left hand vs. a sinusoidal target force with the right hand vs. a steady target force with the left hand vs. a steady target force with the right hand). The analysis, shown in \autoref{fig:results}, yielded different results for younger and late middle-aged adults. Classification of hand side in the late middle-aged participants performed significantly worse, i.e., the classifier misclassified trials performed with the right hand as left-handed trials and vice versa. On the other hand, the classification of which target force was followed, i.e. steady vs sinus, worked significantly better in the late middle-aged adults.
