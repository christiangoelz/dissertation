This research article aimed to investigate whether age-related differences in the central processing of fine motor skills can be captured by machine learning based on the classification of different force control tasks in younger and older adults.\\
\\
To describe the classifier input, we used classical statistical methods first. Next, we trained a classifier for each participant to output the appropriate task label based on the \gls{eeg} data recorded during a trial. That is, the classifier should be able to identify, given the \gls{eeg} data, whether the subject was tracking a sinusoidal target force with the left hand or right hand or whether the task was to track a steady target force with the right or left hand. We compared the \gls{dmd} derived brain activity patterns between the groups and tasks with permutation t-tests and the classification performance between the groups with Man-Whitney-U tests.\\
\\
We found significant differences in the expression of \gls{dmd} patterns between the tasks and groups focusing mainly on central and posterior electrodes, most pronounced in the $\beta$ frequency bands but also in the $\alpha$ and $\theta$ frequency ranges (see Figures 2 to 4 in \hyperref[pub:paperI]{Publishes Research Article \uproman{1}}). In addition, there were group differences in the spatial distribution concerning a more bilateral and frontal expression of the patterns in the late middle-aged adults.\\
The classifiers' performance was above chance level within all participants (accuracy: M~=~0.66, SD~=~0.11; theoretical chance level: 0.25) and yielded distinct misclassification patterns between younger and late middle-aged adults (see \autoref{fig:results1}). The classification of the hand side in the late middle-aged participants performed significantly worse compared to young adults, i.e., the classifier misclassified trials performed with the right hand as left-handed trials and vice versa (accuracy late middle-aged adults: M~=~70~\%, SD~=~8~\%; accuracy young adults: M~=~82~\%, SD~=~9~\%; U~=~39.5, p~=~0.02, r~=~0.45). On the other hand, the classification of which target force was followed, i.e., steady vs. sinus, worked significantly better in the late middle-aged adults (accuracy late middle-aged adults: M~=~86~\%, SD~=~9~\%; accuracy young adults: M~=~75~\%, SD~=~9~\%; U~=~40.00, p~=~0.02, r~=~0.45). Consequently, fewer steady trials were classified as sinusoidal trials in the late middle-aged compared to the younger participants or vice versa.
