%Driven by ever-increasing amounts of data and advancing computer infrastructure, the field of \gls{ai} is becoming increasingly influential in social important areas. 
\Gls{ai} is a field of computer science aiming at building computer systems capable of doing things that require human intelligence. The field has been receiving a lot of attention lately. This is driven by the development and commercialization of generative systems capable of generating realistic images or communicative interaction as well as their impact on society \cite{lin2023}. Other applications already exist in many socially relevant areas including public transportation, e.g., autonomous or self driving vehicles \cite{Leonard2020}, the medical sector, e.g, diagnostic imaging \cite{Liu2020} or social interaction \cite{Adamopoulou2020}, e.g. tools for communicative interaction \cite{Chatgpt_openai_web}. Yet, progress in science is more and more characterized by the application of complex methods from \gls{ai} such as algorithms from machine learning, which make it possible to analyze large and complex amounts of data systematically \cite{Brunton2019}. This has led to proclamations of an "\gls{ai} revolution in science" \cite{Appenzeller2017} or promoting science has entered the fourth paradigm characterized by \textit{data-intensive computing} \cite{Hey2009}. However, in comparison to the rapid development in commercial aspects, the application of machine learning in research outside the mathematical and computer science area is in its infancy and the most effective applications and integration into the traditional science systems remain to be evaluated \cite{Bzdok2019}.  Nevertheless, \gls{ai} and machine learning as a key technology becomes a hope for solving societal challenges.\\
One of the greatest challenges is the demographic shift towards an older population which poses enormous demands for society as a whole raising issues for the healthcare system, infrastructure, family policy, and the occupational sector \cite{who_aging2023}. To avoid overloading social structures, one of the main goals is the promotion of healthy, independent aging improving quality of live in old age. This is not only due to distinguishing age-related diseases from healthy aging at an early stage but as well to develop and evaluate targeted intervention or design adaptive systems. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to understand the dynamics of age-related changes in the context of individual trajectories and overall patterns. An understanding of these changes at the level of the brain is of particular interest, as this can be considered the basis of age-related changes in behavior and cognition \cite{}. To avoid overburdening social structures, one of the main goals is to promote healthy, independent aging and improve the quality of life in old age. This involves not only distinguishing age-related diseases from healthy aging at an early stage, but also developing and evaluating targeted interventions or designing assistive systems. To achieve this, it is necessary to understand the dynamics of age-related changes in the context of individual trajectories and overall patterns. Understanding and quantifying these changes at the level of the brain is of particular interest, as this can be seen as the basis for age-related changes in behavior and cognition.

% However, such applications in research and smart technologies are still under development.\\
% Acceptance and targeted use of \gls{ai} based technology requires piloting of application areas in science and practice. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to identify and apply machine learning techniques to address age-related changes of the brain such as the study of neurophysiological underpinnings and influencing factors of sensorimotor and cognitive changes. Using machine learning the intention is to test to what extent hypotheses about age related changes of the brain can be confirmed, new hypotheses can be formed and derivations for the development of targeted interventions and smart technologies can be made.

% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Age related changes occur at different scales and are manifestet at several levels.
%  \item There is a wide variety in how this changes occur
%  \item Changes are e.g. neural dedifferentiation and compensatory mechanisms (see Reuter Lorenz et al. 2010) and are noticable brain network level and dynamics
