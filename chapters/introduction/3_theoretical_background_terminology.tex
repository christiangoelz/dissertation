\subsection{Machine learning}
Machine learning emerged in the 1950s as a subbranch of artificial intelligence to enable computers to learn without being explicitly programmed \cite{Samual1959}. It is defined by algorithms that automatically extract patterns and trends from data or in other words learn from data \cite{Hastie2009}. With big datasets being openly available and availability of computing power, machine learning is the basis of many advances in science and engineering including public transportation, e.g., autonomous vehicles \cite{Leonard2020}, the medical sector, e.g. diagnostic imaging \cite{Liu2020} or basic science, e.g. understanding protein structure \cite{Jumper2021}. With possibility for the automatic analysis of complex multidimensional data machine learning bears great potential for science \cite{Brunton2019}.\\
Machine learning can be subdivided into three categories, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. In supervised machine learning the goal is to learn a model representing the relationship between data and associated information or description, a so-called label. This model can than be used to predict the label of new data that not have been used during model creation. If the labels are categorical, this process is called classification; for continuous labels, the term is regression. The goal of unsupervised machine learning is to find hidden structure in data without taking into account associated labels. This could be grouping similar data points, i.e. clustering, or uncovering a meaningful low dimensional representation of the data, i.e. dimensionality reduction. Rather than a specific label in reinforcement learning the goal is to learn optimal actions to solve a certain problem by maximizing the reward linked to that action.

\subsubsection{Applications on Neuroscience}
Aiming at building an artificial general intelligence machine learning algorithms and technology were inspired by the working principle of the brain leading to advances of neural networks \cite{Macpherson2021} and neuromorphic computing \cite{Choi2022}. As already introduced machine learning on the other side offers great tools for a wide variety of problems addressed areas of neuroscience. 

- Clinical: identify disease, develop biomarkers, characterize patients, epilepsy detection/prediction
- Basic: Understand working principle of processing, e.g. visual system, working memory
- Cognitive: Identify brain states and study brain behavior interaction

Summary: 
- Solving engineering problems as well as understanding brain processing 
- Investigate high dimensional representations with classification/regression/model selection 
- Uncover underlying processes with dimensionality reduction


\section{Age related reorganization of the brain}
Age related reorganization processes are detectable at the whole body. This is underpinned by multiple interacting biological systems operating on several spatial and temporal scales contributing to the complexity of the phenomenon \cite{Mooney2016}. At the behavioral level these processes are noticeable in changes in cognitive, motor and sensory functioning [QUELLE]. Aging is one of the biggest risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, as well as Parkinson's disease making the brain as one of the target systems to study. Patterns of reorganization of the brain are highly individual as they are subject to genetic and environmental influences [QUELLEN]. At the same time, however, overarching, generalizable patterns can be detected [QUELLE]\\
On a structural level aging has been associated with a reduction in gray matter with an onset early in life
