\section{The brain as a complex Network}
	\subsection{Brain Networks and their Dynamics}
	The brain is formed by interconnected neurons and neuronal populations representing a complex network. 
	This network forms the basis of the function of central information processing and thus the basis of 
	perception and action. On a global level, this represents the separation and integration of functionally 
	specialized brain areas that change based on the environmental context. 
	- During rest several brain networks have been identified:\\
	    - DMN, SMN, DAN etc. \\ 
		- formed by spatially separated but functionally integrated and connected brain areas
		- hirarchy\\
	- This network is assumed to be multiscale in nature \\
